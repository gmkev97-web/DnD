Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They don't need to sleep but enter a trance when they rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations. Over the millennia, different tribes adapted to their respective environments, which explains the following subspecies:
