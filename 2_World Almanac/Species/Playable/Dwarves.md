The Iron folk, the drunken folk or even called the cavesfolk. As hairless as elves are, dwarves are known for long beards and sometimes coaty limbhair. It keeps them warm in the cold caves, that so often call to them. Also known for their love of their craft traditionally mining and processing iron and stone.
