Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They don't need to sleep but enter a trance when they rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations. Over the millennia, different tribes adapted to their respective environments, which explains the differences in the following lineages:


**High Elf**

| Name       | High Elf                                                                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed      | 9m - 30ft                                                                          |
| Darkvision | 18m - 60ft                                                                         |
| Lifespan   | 800 years                                                                          |
| legal age  | 200 years                                                                          |
| Level 1    | Cantrip Prestidigitation - can be replaced with [[wizard]] cantrip after long rest |
| Level 3    | Detect Magic                                                                       |
| Level 5    | Misty Step                                                                         |
They consider themselves as purest form of elven heritage. They are known for their fine crafts, high artisanship and their sometimes more observing behaviour. Also they are known for their rituals, even if they sometimes feel overly fancy...


**Forest Elf**

| Name       | Forest Elf         |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Speed      | 10m - 35ft         |
| Darkvision | 18m - 60ft         |
| Lifespan   | 750 years          |
| legal age  | 150 years          |
| Level 1    | Druidcraft         |
| Level 3    | Longstrider        |
| Level 5    | Pass without Trace |
Often considered the most in touch with nature, Forest Elves are known to wander and record the world around them. Some of them settle in cities, that prioritize nature first. Sometimes they can be blind to new technology. 


**Drow

| Name       | Drow           |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Speed      | 9m - 30ft      |
| Darkvision | 36m - 180ft    |
| Lifespan   | 750 years      |
| legal age  | 100 years      |
| Level 1    | Dancing Lights |
| Level 3    | Faerie Fire    |
| Level 5    | Darkness       |
Known as the "evil" elven folk, the darkish skinned drow are known for the night. They adapted to it and it's more evil nature, as the whole culture can feel a bit rough sometimes. But Drow may also be the most individualistic elves, where the destiny of the individual is the priority, so don't judge a book by it's color.


Non Playable:
Sea Elf
Astral Elf
