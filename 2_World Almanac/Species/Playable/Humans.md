Though many other species find them "basic" and "boring", humans thrive with their willpower. They have quickly adapted to living in almost all lands, despite being the slaves of other species for millennia. Humans are known to work together and have great and sometimes goals for their (relatively speaking) short lifespans. They are often responsible for the biggest changes in the history of the world.
