Aasimar are not a species like the other ones in [[placeholder]] - anyone can be parent to one. They are blessed by a deity, so they only make out a small part of the population. They carry a spark of the upper planes in their soul. Their looks ressemble the ones of the parents species (for example, human, tiefling, halfling...)
